===> Make Result: 
success

===> Marking Scheme - test cases
There are 9 test input files. Input files 01 through 08 test specific functionality. Each line in those files is worth 1 mark, for a total of 67 marks. Test 09 stress tests the code by inserting/erasing/playing a huge number of times. It is worth 33 marks total, graded as follows:
+3: did not segfault
Then, there are 501 lines in that file:
+10: at least 50% of the lines correct
+20: at least 75% of the lines correct
+30: all lines correct
With no part marks (so if they get 65% of the lines correct they donâ€™t get +15, just +10).
